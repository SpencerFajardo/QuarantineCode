# QuarantineCode
This code is a proof of concept for using linux terminal, and vscode.
I added a vim plugin to vscode to try that out as well.
Before this, I have only ever used Windows OS.

This project consists of a c++ program that calculates the number of days in quarantine
since March 14th, 2020 and the current date, and a python web scraper that finds relevant
information about the coronavirus from various websites. A shell script is needed to glue
the two parts together.

To run the files together, type the following into your terminal:
./shell.sh
